# Main_Projects

A place where I post the main projects I've worked on.
These can cover either projects that I've made for school, solo or in team, or just spare time projects that I'm proud of.

If you want more details about these projects, you can go to my site to read those.

Feel free to take a look at the code or use anything as long as you give credit.
